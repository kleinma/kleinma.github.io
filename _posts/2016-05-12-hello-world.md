title: Hello World!
---

Hello World! This is my first post on a website that has been a long time coming. I originally created a website with [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com). However, once the $96 annual renewal fee came around, I decided to transfer everything over to my github.io repository. It's totally free! But, now I have to learn a bit of HTML and CSS in the process. I'm also using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to build the site's HTML. With Jekyll, custom page layouts can be designed once, and the rest of the focus can be put towards content. Just like CSS separates the style from the content, Jekyll helps separate the layout from the content.

My goals for this website are to present my research projects, maintain my CV, and blog a bit about my hobbies and interests. I hope you enjoy! Feel free to contact me with any comments or questions.
